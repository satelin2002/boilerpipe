The move could slash pension benefits to city workers and retirees, and leave bond holders with only pennies on the dollar.\nThe bankruptcy was filed by Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr and approved by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder said the financial condition of the city left him no choice.\n\"Now\u0027s our opportunity to stop 60 years of decline,\" Snyder said at a Friday news conference with Orr. \"How long had this been going on and people were kicking the can down the road and not doing something? We\u0027re doing something.\"\nSnyder has said that 38% of the city\u0027s budget is being spent on \"legacy costs,\" such as pensions and debt service. He said police take almost an hour to respond to calls, compared to a national average of 11 minutes, and that 40% of street lights in the city are turned off.\n\"Does anybody think it\u0027s OK to have 40-year-old trees growing through the roofs of dilapidated houses,\" Orr said.\nBut public employee unions are sure to fight the move, charging that the city did not negotiate in good faith and should not be allowed to walk away from obligations made to employees and retirees.\nThe Detroit Fire Fighters Association said it was \"very disappointed\" with the bankruptcy filing.\n\"We are working with other Detroit employees to form a unified coalition to address the financial concerns of Detroit,\" the group said. \"Detroit\u0027s Fire Fighters will continue to protect and serve during this difficult time, regardless of the economic challenges.\"\nOrr already halted payments on about $2 billion in debt last month, saying the city needed to preserve its dwindling supply of cash. The city faces total liabilities of about $18 billion.\nOrr\u0027s reorganization plan calls for cutting $11.5 billion in debt down to $2 billion. That would mean that investors and retirees would receive an average of just 17% of what they are owed. Specific plans for the cuts are unknown at this time.\nMarket indexes are shown in real time, except for the DJIA, which is delayed by two minutes. All times are ET.
